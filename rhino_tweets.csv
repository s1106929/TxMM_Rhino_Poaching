These two Rhinos were found with their faces hacked off by poachers. Sadly they had to be euthanized to end their suffering.

Why are Rhinos being killed for their horns?? For TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE!!!

This orphaned black rhino is 1 of an estimated 745 individuals left in Kenya. His mum died of natural causes so we’re caring for him now & will continue to until he is old enough to return to the protected wild: https://sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/news/updates/apollo-one-month-on…

Thankfully, there has been a decrease in the number of #rhino poached across Africa since the peak of 1,349 in 2015.

However, 892 African rhino were poached in 2018 and numbers are still appallingly high.
